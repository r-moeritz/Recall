# Recall

> For the memory of a lifetime, Recall, Recall, Recall.

A memoization and caching library for .NET with support for asynchronous methods.

## Usage

See simple task async example below. Further examples included in source distribution.

```csharp
const int QueryDuration = 5000;
const int QueryArg = 255;

static void Main()
{
    Console.WriteLine("Executing queries. Please be patient.");
    
    var memoizedTaskAsyncFunc = UberMemoizer.DefaultInstance.MemoizeTask<int, int>(TaskAsyncQuery);

    ExecuteTaskAsyncQuery(memoizedTaskAsyncFunc, QueryArg).Wait();
    ExecuteTaskAsyncQuery(memoizedTaskAsyncFunc, QueryArg).Wait();

    Console.Write("Press any key to exit.");
    Console.Read();
}

static Task ExecuteTaskAsyncQuery(MemoizedTaskAsyncFunc<int, int> query, int arg)
{
    var clock = new Stopwatch();
    clock.Start();

    return query.InvokeAsync(arg).ContinueWith(
        task =>
            {
                clock.Stop();
                Console.WriteLine("{0} results returned in {1} seconds",
                                  task.Result.Count(), clock.Elapsed.TotalSeconds);
            });
}

static Task<IEnumerable<int>> TaskAsyncQuery(int arg)
{
    return Task.Factory.StartNew(
        () =>
            {
                Thread.Sleep(QueryDuration);
                return Enumerable.Range(0, Int16.MaxValue)
                    .Where(i => i < arg);
            });
}
```
